Now, I quite like board games, especially the more complex Euro-style games (like Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride). But what I *really* like is a gigantic steaming pile of data like this site. BGG also has a (recently improved) API so we can mostly avoid the heartache of trying to parse HTML from a page in the wild. \n",

    "### The Anatomy of Scraping and API Calls\n",
    "Using `requests` with `BeatifulSoup` is almost too easy. You send the server a single URL and it sends you back a response - you'll get HTML if your URL was just a normal page on the site, and you'll get XML back if instead your URL reflects the API format. (I'm just talking about the BGG API here - the documentation for which is [here (version 1)](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API#) and [here (version 2)](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2#toc11)). Then you simply parse the response text with `BeatifulSoup` using the appropriate parser. Here is the basic anatomy of what we'll be doing (this example is an API call, returning XML):"

Here I'm going to request the HTLM for each page in the pages of results for browsing all boardgames. This actually works quite well as I can specify that I want to browse a list sorted by number of ratings, in descending order, and in this way I can cut off the scraping when I reach whatever ratings sparsity I want (maybe somewhere around 100 ratings per game?). I'm starting the scrape from [this page](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame/page/1?sort=numvoters&sortdir=desc). Remember to code in a short time delay (one or two seconds) between server requests, otherwise you might get your IP blacklisted, you hacker! For now the only info I'll pull is the game ID (an integer), the game name, the number of ratings, and the URL for a thumbnail pic of the game."

The chunk you get is controlled by the `page` parameter of the request so you should make a loop which keeps sending request, incrementing page each time, until the result is empty (you incremented past the last page of stuff). Remember that an empty list will evaluate to boolean `False` so we can use that to control our loop."

That's OK, it's just a toy set for now.

    "### Getting Ratings for Multiple Games at Once\n",
    "Instead of going game-by-game, each API call I make will request the $n^{th}$ page of ratings for multiple games at once - I can do this just by providing a list of integer game IDs in the `id=` parameter of the URL. I'll set up a vector that initializes to the number of *full* (meaning has 100 comments) pages for each game ID, and then after each API call I'll decrement every element by one. Each call will include in its `id=` list only game ids who still have $npages > 0$. Even when we provide a list of IDs the response comments don't have any attribute indicating which game they belong to (why???), but they will be ordered according to the `id` list. That's why I will only be pulling *full* pages of ratings - that allows me to know that the first 100 comments map to the first game ID that I provided etc. At the end we can run through game-by-game and grab the last partial page of ratings for each game. And finally, to complicate things even further, we can't provide a list of all the game ids at once because the response will be too big, so we'll have to do the above procedure on just one chunk of the games at a time.
