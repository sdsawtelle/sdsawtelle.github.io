    "I recently started freelance data sciencing on [Upwork](upwork.com), which is awesome! My second contract there involved writing some Python for a client who wanted to be able to execute various analyses and visualizations from his data on securities trading. Since I was essentially responsible for delivering a piece of software to this dude, I spent a little bit of time reading on how to structure a project like this. What I discovered was a pretty solid concensus on how all publicly distributed python packages (modules) should be structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I conformed the client's code to this standard python package structure and documented the hell out of it. Then something amazing happened... I felt like I had actually created a persistent, useful tool and code base for myself and this guy, rather than a collection of haphazard scripts with a workflow that nobody would be able to easily reproduce one month hence. So here is the revolutionary idea, **treat your data science projects like python packages - structure them the same, standard way each time and document the crap out of them.**"

    "# Use an Environment, I Beg You\n",
    "Please, for the love of god, use a virtual environment for any substantial project involving code you might ever want to reuse. I can reassure you that although they sound crazy technical they are actually *dead simple* to use. A virtual environment is like a self-contained, preserved, install of a specific version of python and packages. It let's you completely reproduce the working environment for your code at any time - you'll never again break ALL the things by updating!\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more boring and realistic sense, **a virtual environment is just an isolated folder holding specific versions of python and packages.** You make a virtual environment by indicating which version of python should be copied into your new directory (or specify the path from which to grab python) and it will also install the pip package into the environment by default. After this you can enter the virtual environment and use `pip` (or `conda`) like normal to add packages, *but they will be installed into your new virtual environment directory.* **Being inside a virtual environment is just like telling your OS that your python executable and your PATH (where it looks for modules) have moved to the new virtual environment directory.** \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way of managing virtual environments in Python is with the package manager `pip` and a 3rd party tool `virtualenv` (in Python 3 there is built-in support and you use `pyenv` instead of `virtualenv`). But Conda, the package management solution that ships with the Anaconda distribution of Python has it's own (better) approach for virtual environments. \n",
