    "So, I have a Windows machine that I'm rather fond of. Maybe you do too. The unfortunate thing about this situation is that Unix shell (commonly `bash`) is much more common than Windows system shell in the quantitative computing universe. In the World of Windows we don't really have much of a culture around command line, and so I'm basically a giant command line noob. Once I began poking around in the data science ecosystem it became clear that this was a pretty large gap in my skill set. Not just the lack of `bash` language skills but also just the lack of command line in my work flow , and I was curious what I was missing. Turns out my timing on this issue is great, because the most recent update to Windows 10 rolled out a feature that is going to let me play around with native `bash` pretty seamlessly - it's called the [Windows Subystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/faq) (WSL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting freaky with `bash`, I'd like to point out that I *really* like the idea of my work flow being operating system agnostic. And I *really really* like the idea of minimizing the number of tools and languages I depend on. But at the same time I think I should have *some* degree of familiarity with `bash` because it's everywhere, and because I'm sure some things are just easier with the right `bash` one-liner or the right command line tool. So I'm trying to build a command line work flow that is *mostly* operating system agnostic (read: `Python`) while still learning some useful `bash` with this WSL voodoo.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this post is for Windows users doing scientific computing, and who are noobs at Unix command line but who want to fix that by playing with the new WSL, but who still want to do most stuff in Python not `bash`. Not counting myself that might be the empty set, I dunno. Anyway, here I'll describe what the hell `bash` even is and how `IPython` is actally a viable alternative console. Then I'll outline how to get your WSL up and running, and then how to get your Anaconda toolset up and running on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll gradually build out the specific functionality in Python that can replace a lot of what `bash` is commonly used for, and I may put that into a later post."

    "# What is the Shell Even For?\n",
    "To kick off [with Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell): \n",
    ">Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window, where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read commands from a file, called a script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching),piping, ... variables and control structures.... \n",
    "\n",
    "`Bash` and shells in general are heavily used for stuff in the realm of sys admin, like operating on files and commands such as configs or logs (see [this on quora](https://www.quora.com/Can-Python-fully-replace-a-shell-script-such-as-Bash-or-zsh-in-Linux-administration)). But `bash` is also very useful when most of what you're doing is communicating and piping between various specialized programs or tools (see [this on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2872041/is-there-any-use-for-bash-scripting-anymore)) where it acts like a kind of [*glue* language](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199331/is-it-worth-learning-bash-when-i-know-perl):\n",
    ">`Bash` epitomises the spirit of UNIX -- combining multiple simple tools to solve a more complex problem, usually using pipes to direct the output of one command to the input of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a large set of these specialized utilities that `bash` integrates - `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `scp`... I've heard of most of these super adorable names, though I don't know what they do. ([This article](http://practical-data-science.blogspot.com/2012/09/basic-unix-shell-commands-for-data.html) summarizes some of the more useful commands and command line tools for doing data science.) \n",
    "\n",
    "More to the point for my purposes, in contemplating using Python in place of `bash`, [this stackoverflow response](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2872171/4639070e) captures the fundamental difference:\n",
    "> ...python is a general purpose scripting language, while bash is simply a way to run a myriad of small (and often very fast) programs in a series. Python can do this, but it is not optimized for it. The programs (sort, find, uniq, scp) might do very complex tasks very simply, and bash allows these tasks to interoperate very simply with piping, flushing output in and out from files or devices etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data science work rather than hardcore sys admin, I'm optimistic that I can use Python with a few modules to replace a large chunk of the work done by these microtools. I think for my purposes it's mostly going to be working with files and directories, at least to start. So onward to choosing a terminal! "
