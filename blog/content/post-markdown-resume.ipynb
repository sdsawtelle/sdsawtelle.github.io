    "Changing the content or styling of a resume or CV is a relatively common event that can be frustrating andtime-consuming. This post outlines the simplest possible workflow where resume content is maintained in a simple markdown file and generating `.html`, `.pdf` and `.docx` output formats is automated with a few lines of code. Styling of the outputs requires maintaining one `.css` sheet and one reference Word doc, and even if you aren't familiar with such things I can give you some basic steps for re-styling. \n",

    "# The Plan.\n",
    "We'll need just two tools. `Pandoc`: the swiss army knife of interconverting file formats, and `wkhtmtopdf` the precision scalpel (?) of printing HTML to PDFs. Here is the simplest workflow:\n",
    "1. Use pandoc to convert .md to .html, with styling via a .css file\n",
    "2. Use `wkhtmltopdf` to print .html as .pdf\n",
    "3. Use pandoc to convert .md to .docx with styling via a .docx reference file\n",
    "\n",
    "The pdf could alternatively be generated from the markdown using pandoc with a `LaTex` engine and a `.tex` template, but it's more efficient to just borrow the styling from the HTML."
