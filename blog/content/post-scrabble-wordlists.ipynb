    "# In which I use python to make a cheat sheet and then school my husband at scrabble.<sup>[1]</sup> \n",
    "\n",
    "The husband and I play a lot of scrabble. We are serious enough about it to use *all* the two and three letter words (these include \"aa\", \"xu\", \"cwm\" among other nonsense) and the fancy \"J\", \"X\", \"Z\" and \"Q\" words. But we're not serious enough about it to memorize these words, so we cheat and refer to word lists while we play. There are lots of word lists already out there, but we're obsessively minimalist and didn't want a sheaf of print-outs floating around - we wanted a comprehensive, compact cheat sheet that would fit on just two laminated pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deal with playable words in scrabble is that tournament players use the *Official Word List* (OWL) while often family or club games use the *Official Scrabble Players Dictionary* (OSPD). The OSPD is endorsed by Hasbro Inc. and is basically the OWL minus any word that could be considered even mildly offensive. An interesting history of this craziness can be found [here]( http://scrabble.wonderhowto.com/news/controversy-changed-scrabble-0114722/) and a titillating list of the expurgated words is [here](http://www.seattlescrabble.org/expurg.php).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every so often new versions of the OWL and OSPD are released, and we wanted our cheat sheet to be current with the most recent OWL3. For some reason I had a really hard time finding an electronic copy of this list anywhere, but it looks like [this](https://freeowl3.wordpress.com/) is a valid one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted a cheat sheet that was just two pages, each front and back, that we could laminate. We wanted it to have the following things:\n",
    "- two-to-make-threes (two letter words with their valid front and back hook letters)\n",
    "- three-to-make-fours\n",
    "- \"J\" words up to five letters\n",
    "- \"X\" words up to five letters\n",
    "- \"Z\" words up to five letters\n",
    "- \"Q\" words up to five letters\n",
    "- \"Q\" words without a \"U\"\n",
    "- vowel dumps (words with at least 66% vowels)\n",
    "- \"U\" vowel dumps (words with at least 66% \"U\"s)\n",
    "- \"I\" vowel dumps\n",
    "- list of the top six and seven-letter-stems for bingos\n",
    "\n",
    "So this Python project consists of pulling in a complete word list, using it to selectively create the above subsets, writing the individual subsets to file, and then using the cheat sheet to destroy my husband at Scrabble. To skip ahead a bit, here are the outputs that you might be interested in:\n",
    "- A text file of the [full OWL3 word list](images/post-scrabble-wordlists/OWL3_Dictionary.txt)\n",
    "- A set of [text files for the above word lists](images/post-scrabble-wordlists/OWL3_wordlists.7z)\n",
    "- PDF of the final [OWL3 Cheat Sheet #1](images/post-scrabble-wordlists/OWL3_Cheat_Sheet1_lists.pdf) (J, Q, X, Z, 2-to-make-3s, vowel dumps)\n",
    "- PDF of the final [OWL3 Cheat Sheet #2](images/post-scrabble-wordlists/OWL3_Cheat_Sheet2_3sto4s.pdf) (3-to-make4s)\n",

    "Hooking is a really useful technique in scrabble where you modify a word that's already on the board by adding one or more tiles either to the front or end of the word. The two and three letter words often have a lot of allowable single-letter hooks so it is helpful to have a list of the same. We can use the two, three and four-length lists to make an array which holds the information about what are valid hooks for each two-letter word, and another array to do likewise for three-letter words. For instance, the two-letter-hooks array will consist of a single row for each two-letter word, where the row has three elements: the first element is valid prefixes, the second element is the two-letter word and the third element is valid suffixes."

That means for a two or three-letter word it must be all vowels, for a four-letter word it must be three vowels, and for a five-letter word it must be four vowels. We will also want to make specific \"I\" dumps and \"U\" dumps which are defined as words containing at least 66% \"U\"s or \"I\"s respectively.\n",
