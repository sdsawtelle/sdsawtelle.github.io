Sonya Sawtelle, quantitative problem solver

This is the repo for my personal website where I collect posts I've written, projects I've done, and general info about myself.

The posts (blog) component is built using Pelican and the clean-blog template. The landing page, projects page and about page I built myself from scratch.

## Ongoing Improvements List
- change header layout to be more similar to [weasyprint](http://weasyprint.org/)
  - nav links left-justified and in capital letters: HOME, POSTS, PROJECTS, ABOUT
  - nav links right-justified and in lower case: email, github, linkedin, resume
